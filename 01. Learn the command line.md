# 01. Learn the command line

## Glossary

- **Graphical user interface / GUI:** A way to interact with your computer using a pointer (clicking, dragging, business as usual)
- **Command line / command line interface / CLI:** A way to interact with your computer by typing commands. Limited pointer interaction (you can scroll and select text, but that's basically it)
- **Terminal / Console / Shell / Command prompt:** Software application where you can type commands
- **Bash:** A popular shell (there are many others, the same way that there are many different word processors and Microsoft Word is one of them)

## Setup

- **Mac or Linux:** You can run commands from your Terminal application.

- **Windows:** Install [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) to run commands there.

## Homework

- [Learn the command line on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

- Once you're done learning online, try some commands on your own computer.

## Goals

Each little topic can open a whole rabbit hole unto itself, so these goals are here to help you focus on the basics needed to move forward to the next lesson.

The homework material will explicitly address some of these goals. For the rest, you should now be comfortable enough to find the answers yourself with some independent googling.

- Understand that if you read documentation asking you to type commands, you should ignore the `$` at the start of the line. E.g. if someone says to type `$ pwd`, it just means "In your terminal, type `pwd`". [This discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19986306/what-does-the-mean-when-running-commands) goes into more detail if this isn't clear.

- As a minimum, you should be familiar with the
  following commands. You can experiment with these safely, they won't break anything.

  - `$ pwd`
  - `$ cd <path>`
  - `$ ls`
  - `$ ls -Ga1` (try `$ man ls` if that one is confusing)
  - `$ cd ..`
  - `$ cd -`

- Understand that you can terminate a running process (so you can type a new command) with the key combination **ctrl+c**. This is basically a shortcut for closing and reopening your terminal.

- Understand that you can quit out of many display screens (such as [man pages](https://opensource.com/article/17/7/using-man-pages)) by typing **q**
