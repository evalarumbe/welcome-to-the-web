# Set up your password manager

If you're not yet using a password manager, please [set up LastPass for free](https://www.lastpass.com/).

When working with websites you will need to keep track of many passwords and share some of them with colleagues and clients.

A password manager can also improve the security of your personal accounts if you follow recommendations and make the most of it.

## The only passwords you should need to memorise

**Make all these [both strong and memorable](https://www.malwarefox.com/set-strong-memorable-passwords/)**

1. Master password to your password manager
2. Passwords to unlock devices (Computer, Apple ID)
3. Email password (recovery email will go here if you sign in from new devices)
