# Set up your password manager

With the power of being creative on the Internet comes the responsibility to pay attention to security: your own, and that of anyone who uses what you build.

If you're not yet using a password manager, please [set up LastPass for free](https://www.lastpass.com/).

When working with websites you will need to keep track of many passwords and share some of them with colleagues and/or clients.

A password manager can also improve the security of your personal accounts if you follow recommendations and make the most of it.

## The only passwords you should need to memorise

**Make all these [both strong and memorable](https://www.malwarefox.com/set-strong-memorable-passwords/)**.

1. Master password to your password manager
2. Passwords to unlock devices (Computer, Apple ID)
3. Email password (recovery email will go here if you sign in from new devices)
4. Anything you'll need to type in when you don't have easy access to LastPass. Since LastPass has great phone apps too, this should be very few situations if any.

## Easing into LastPass

If the idea of changing your whole password workflow seems daunting, I'd recommend moving over to LastPass in separate steps:

### 1. Set up LastPass

Install the LastPass mobile app and browser extension, and set up a secure master password.

### 2. Get familiar with LastPass

Save your existing passwords in LastPass. At this point you should have them all saved, but also memorised the way you had them before.

Keep things this way for a few weeks until you get the hang of using LastPass on a daily basis.

Avoid typing in passwords during this time, and rely using LastPass as much as possible until it becomes natural.

Log out of your accounts, and log back in with LastPass. Poke around in your LastPass Vault and get familiar with it.

Challenge yourself to type your master password many many times during this phase, as well as your email password and any others that you need to memorise (listed above).

If anything goes wrong because this is still new, (e.g. if you forget your master password), you won't have lost access to anything because you still have your passwords memorised.

### 3. Secure your LastPass workflow

Once you're using LastPass all the time and you know you can rely on yourself to type your master password on a tired and bleary day, you're ready to step up the security. This is where password managers really shine.

At this point, use a password generator to create super secure passwords (go for length and variety) and update your existing passwords for any accounts that aren't in the above 'to memorise' list.

Generally, the longer the better, but some apps / websites will require you to stay under a certain length.

LastPass also happen to offer a [password generator](https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php) that anyone can use, without needing to have a LastPass account.

Make sure each password is updated in two places. For example if I was updating my MailChimp password, I'd make sure that: 1) MailChimp knows about it, and 2) it's saved in my LastPass.

Make sure you generate a different password for each service, so if one password is compromised, it's useless for gaining access to anything else.

### 4. Sit back and feel good about your online security

Your workflow now should be at the point where you don't know most of your passwords, only the above few (and those ones are long and varied). You've found the sweet balance between security and convenience, well done.
